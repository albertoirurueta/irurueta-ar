/**
 * This class defines the interface for an estimator of the Image of Absolute
 * Conic (IAC). The IAC is directly related to pinhole camera intrinsic
 * parameters, implementations of this estimator can be used for camera
 * calibration purposes.
 * Depending on the constraints imposed on the intrinsic parameters of the
 * camera, some parameters of the IAC will be known in advance and fewer
 * equations will be needed.
 * If no constraints are imposed, then at least 5 equations will be needed to
 * estimate the DIAC, and hence 3 homographies will be required (2 equations can
 * be obtained for each homography). 2*n &lt;= 5 ==&lt; n &lt;= 5/2 ==&lt; n &lt;= 2.5 ==&lt;
 * n &lt;= 3
 * If skewness is assumed to be known and zero, then one less homography is
 * required, hence only 2 homographies will be needed.
 * 2*n + 1 &lt;= 5 ==&lt; n &lt;= 4 / 2 ==&lt; n &lt;= 2
 * If also principal point is assumed to be known and located at image center
 * (origin of coordinates), then 2 fewer equations are needed, and hence only
 * 1 homography is needed:
 * 2n + 1 + 2 &lt;= 5 ==&lt; n &lt;= 2 / 2 ==&lt; n &lt;= 1
 * By enabling constraints, results are guaranteed to be more stable (estimation
 * fails fewer times with an exception) and more accurate, so whenever possible
 * constraints should be enabled. The principal point at origin introduces more
 * stability and accuracy than the skewness constraint, but if possible both
 * should be enabled. By default, both constraints are enable.
