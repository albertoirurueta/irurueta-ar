/**
 * This class defines the interface for an estimator of the Dual Absolute
 * Quadric (DAQ) assuming equal vertical and horizontal focal length, no
 * skewness and principal point at the center of the image.
 * The projection of the Dual Absolute Quadric through a given
 * pinhole camera P, becomes the Dual Image of Absolute Conic (DIAC).
 * Since the DIAC is directly related to the intrinsic parameters K of the
 * camera P used for projection, then by using a pair of arbitrary cameras,
 * it is possible to solve their corresponding focal length, assuming that:
 * - cameras are arbitrary (usually the initial camera is the identity and must
 * be discarded) as it creates a numerical degeneracy.
 * - all provided cameras have the same intrinsic parameters.
 * - it is assumed that skewness is zero, the principal point is at the center
 * of the image plane (zero), and both horizontal and vertical focal planes are
 * equal.
